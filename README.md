# I. Introduction
# II. RFM Analysis
Identifying customer segments is beneficial for selecting profitable customers and developing customer loyalty. RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is a simple technique for behaviour based customer segmentation. It is used to determine quantitatively which customers are the most valuable ones by examining:

- how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- how often they purchase (frequency)
- how much the customer spends (monetary)

# III. Conclusion
### Potential Loyalist
- Close monitoring and customer satisfaction can be increased by direct phone calls.
- Loyalty programs offer incentives such as points or rewards for continued purchases.
### Need Attention
- Product recommendations based on their recent purchase history.
### At Risk
- A customer's shopping experience can be tested by sending a survey through the mail.
- Options such as discount codes can be provided to encourage repeat shopping.
