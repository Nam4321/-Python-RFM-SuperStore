# I. Introduction
SuperStore Company is a global retail company - Global. So the company has many customers.
On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers who have supported the company over the past time. As well as exploiting customers who have the potential to become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to group each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually like in previous years, so we asked the Data Analysis Department to assist in implementing a classification problem. Segment each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

The Marketing Director also suggested using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify it themselves using Excel. Currently, the amount of data is too large, so we want the Data Department to build a flow to deploy Segmentation evaluation through Python programming.

# II. RFM Analysis
Identifying customer segments is beneficial for selecting profitable customers and developing customer loyalty. RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is a simple technique for behaviour based customer segmentation. It is used to determine quantitatively which customers are the most valuable ones by examining:

- how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- how often they purchase (frequency)
- how much the customer spends (monetary)

# III. Conclusion
### Potential Loyalist
- Close monitoring and customer satisfaction can be increased by direct phone calls.
- Loyalty programs offer incentives such as points or rewards for continued purchases.
### Need Attention
- Product recommendations based on their recent purchase history.
### At Risk
- A customer's shopping experience can be tested by sending a survey through the mail.
- Options such as discount codes can be provided to encourage repeat shopping.
