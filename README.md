# I. Introduction
SuperStore Company is a global retail company with a large customer base. On the occasion of Christmas and the New Year, the Marketing department wishes to run marketing campaigns to express gratitude to customers who have supported the company over time, as well as to explore potential customers and turn them into loyal customers.

However, the Marketing department has not yet segmented the customers for this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually as in previous years. Therefore, they are seeking assistance from the Data Analysis department to implement a customer segmentation problem, in order to deploy tailored marketing programs for each customer segment.

The Marketing Director has also proposed using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was smaller, the team could calculate and classify using Excel. With the current large data volume, they hope the Data department can build a deployment flow for Segmentation evaluation using Python programming.

# II. RFM Analysis
Identifying customer segments is beneficial for selecting profitable customers and developing customer loyalty. RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is a simple technique for behaviour based customer segmentation. It is used to determine quantitatively which customers are the most valuable ones by examining:

- how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- how often they purchase (frequency)
- how much the customer spends (monetary)

# III. Conclusion
### Potential Loyalist
- Close monitoring and customer satisfaction can be increased by direct phone calls.
- Loyalty programs offer incentives such as points or rewards for continued purchases.
### Need Attention
- Product recommendations based on their recent purchase history.
### At Risk
- A customer's shopping experience can be tested by sending a survey through the mail.
- Options such as discount codes can be provided to encourage repeat shopping.
